Project Name: Quizzer

Purpose: To be an intuitive system that can distribute tests, record answers, and preform tasks that are helpful to teachers.

Features:
 - test students and record grades
 - multiple choice options are randomized
 - teacher utilities that can only be accessed through a password written in the test document
   - average grade
   - rank students

Procedure for writing a test file:
 1. First line includes the amount of questions in the test, then a space, then the amount of answer choices for each question
 2. Type a phrase that will act as the password for the teacher utilities on the next line
 3. Type the question on one line
 4. Type the answers on seperate lines, the first answer that is after the question must be the correct answer, the possible answers get randomized each distribution
 5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 till all the quesitons are on the test
 6. Save the file as "test.in" in the project folder "Quizzer", the .in will prevent any normal people from editing or viewing it
 7. Clear or create a new file in the "Quizzer" folder called "results.out", this is where the results are stored
 8. Distibute the test and use the teacher utilities to check on the grades!
